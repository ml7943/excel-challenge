Files for the assignment 1 in DS bootcamp.
It includes two files, CrowdfundingBook_assignment1 and Assignment1_Report, with the former being an Excel file and the latter being a Word document. 
The Excel file consists of 6 sheets, namely dataset, pivot table, and graphs. The last sheet is for statistical analysis, which contains the answers to two questions regarding mean and median. However, due to their length, the answers to these two questions are also included in the last part of the Word document. The Word document contains the answers to all the essay questions.
### Please note that I have created all the required graphs, including stacked-column pivot charts and line graphs. However, they sometimes disappear and require a refresh to reappear. If possible, please refresh the charts or click on a blank area to see if the graphs can be selected. 
## If you can't see any graphs, please let me know.
